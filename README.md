# PDF-Table-Extraction
Camelot is a Python library that makes it easy for anyone to extract tables from PDF files! 
Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with its tweakable settings. 
Note: Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. 
(As Tabula explains, "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)
command to install Camelot: pip install camelot-py

**Bad tables can be discarded based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without ever having to manually look at each table.
**Each table is a pandas DataFrame, which seamlessly integrates into ETL and data analysis workflows.
**You can export tables to multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, Excel and HTML.
