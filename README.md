# PDF-Table-Extraction
Camelot is a Python library that makes it easy for anyone to extract tables from PDF files! Note: Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula explains, "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".) Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with its tweakable settings.
